# Warehouse Management

This is a project performed during my training in Lexicon Stockholm. It is focused on implementing Object-oriented programming principles to develop an actual application as an industrial project. The description of the project is shown below.

## Overview
In this exam, you need to build a warehouse management project, which has support for products, storage for storing products, and vehicles for transporting products from one storage to another. The project will consist of entity classes and a controller class, which manages the interaction between the storage, vehicles and products.

## Setup
To set up your project, create a new Visual Studio project with the name “StorageMaster”. The project must have a StartUp class with the namespace “StorageMaster” instead of Program.cs. You are free to use any namespaces you want, as long as you have a class, called StartUp in the StorageMaster namespace.
